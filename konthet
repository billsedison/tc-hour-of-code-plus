Topcoder Hour of Code PLUS is fantastic, i would like to learn how to become a developer
Since i just a self taught graphic designer. I'm interested to learn code. Now I don't know where to start to learn.
This is awesome that topcoder introduce the github. I just started here. I hope some day I can use github rather than adobe products, and doesn't need that freaking apple devices.
