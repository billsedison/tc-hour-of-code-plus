## 24 hours!! - Topcoder Hour of Code PLUS - Fun challenge

[TMALBONPH Issue 26](https://github.com/billsedison/tc-hour-of-code-plus/issues/26)

*Topcoder Hour of Code PLUS is awesome. :)*

This challenge is a `fun challenge for non-Development members` to learn how to use `GitHub`.

`GitHub` is the world's leading software development platform, it is mainly for version control but also for team collaboration. It's widely used in modern development, even for non-Coders. Trust me, it's worthy to spend one hour getting started with it.

### Important Note:

- This is a fun challenge. We will randomly choose 10 eligible members who submitted a valid submission as winners, each winner will receive `$25`.

- If you never participated in a `Development challenge`, then you are `eligible`. We will check your challenge history in your `Topcoder profile` to see if you are eligible.

- You will only need `less than 1 hour to finish the requirement` of this challenge, but the challenge will last 24 hours for the timezone concern.
